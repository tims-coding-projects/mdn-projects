    The first variable — randomNumber — is assigned a random number between 1 and
    100, calculated using a mathematical algorithm. The first three constants are
    each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are
    used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code (note how they are
    inside a <div> element, which is itself used to select all three later on for
    resetting, when we restart the game):

    The next two constants store references to the form text input and submit button
    and are used to control submitting the guess later on.

    Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how
    many guesses the player has had), and a reference to a reset button that doesn't
    exist yet (but will later).

    }

      /*
      The first line declares a variable called userGuess and sets its value to the
      current value entered inside the text field. We also run this value through
      the built-in Number() constructor, just to make sure the value is definitely a
       number. Since we're not changing this variable, we'll declare it using const.

      Next, we encounter our first conditional code block. A conditional code block allows
      you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not.
      It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional
      block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces.
      Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns true, we run the code
      inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code.
      In this case the test is testing whether the guessCount variable is equal to 1
      (i.e. whether this is the player's first go or not)

      If it is, we make the guesses paragraph's text content equal to Previous guesses:. If not, we don't.
      Line 6 appends the current userGuess value onto the end of the guesses paragraph,
      plus a blank space so there will be a space between each guess shown. The next block does
      a few checks.

      The first if(){ } checks whether the user's guess is equal to the randomNumber
      set at the top of our JavaScript. If it is, the player has guessed correctly
      and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a
      nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess information box,
      and run a function called setGameOver(), which we'll discuss later.
      Now we've chained another test onto the end of the last one using an else
      if(){ } structure. This one checks whether this turn is the user's last turn.
      If it is, the program does the same thing as in the previous block, except with
      a game over message instead of a congratulations message. The final block chained
      onto the end of this code (the else { }) contains code that is only run if neither
      of the other two tests returns true (i.e. the player didn't guess right, but
      they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then
      we perform another conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or
      lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them
      higher or lower.

      The last three lines in the function (lines 26–28 above) get us ready for the
      next guess to be submitted. We add 1 to the guessCount variable so the player uses
      up their turn (++ is an incrementation operation — increment by 1), and empty
      the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next
      guess to be entered.
      */

      guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);

      /*
      Here we are adding an event listener to the guessSubmit button. This is a
      method that takes two input values (called arguments) — the type of event
      we are listening out for (in this case click) as a string, and the code we
      want to run when the event occurs (in this case the checkGuess() function).
      Note that we don't need to specify the parentheses when writing it inside
      addEventListener().
      */

      guessField.disabled = true;
      guessSubmit.disabled = true;

    }

    /*
    The first two lines disable the form text input and button by setting their
    disabled properties to true. This is necessary, because if we didn't, the user
    could submit more guesses after the game is over, which would mess things up.
    The next three lines generate a new <button> element, set its text label to
    "Start new game", and add it to the bottom of our existing HTML.
    The final line sets an event listener on our new button so that when it is clicked,
    a function called resetGame() is run.
    */

    guessCount = 1;

    const resetParas = document.querySelectorAll('.resultParas p');

    randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
  }

/*
This rather long block of code completely resets everything to how it was at the
start of the game, so the player can have another go. It:

    Puts the guessCount back down to 1.

    Empties all the text out of the information paragraphs. We select all paragraphs
    inside <div class="resultParas"></div>, then loop through each one, setting their
    textContent to '' (an empty string).

    Removes the reset button from our code.

    Enables the form elements, and empties and focuses the text field, ready for a new guess to be entered.

    Removes the background color from the lastResult paragraph.

    Generates a new random number so that you are not just guessing the same number again!

At this point you should have a fully working (simple) game — congratulations!
