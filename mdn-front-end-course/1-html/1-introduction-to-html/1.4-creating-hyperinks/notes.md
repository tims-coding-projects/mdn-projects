### What is a hyperlink?

- Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL). 


### Anatomy of a link

- A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an a element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
